    <h1>Soup for gastritis</h1>
    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/insaneinthebrine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/rutabaga4.jpg?resize=360%2C240&ssl=1" alt="Soup image">
    <p>Rutabaga is a hearty and satisfying root vegetable. It is actually a member of the cruciferous family of vegetables which includes things like broccoli, cauliflower, kale and more. It is high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Of course, we can see its closer resemblance to cousins like turnips and radishes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>2 medium rutabagas (675g), peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 large leek (whites), chopped</li>
        <li>1T avocado oil</li>
        <li> 4 cups gastritis-friendly chicken stock</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp caraway seed</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dill seed</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cumin seed</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tsp parley flakes</li>
        <li>Optional: 1/4 tsp garlic and onion poeder if tolerated</li>
     </ul> 
      

    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Toast the caraway, dill, and cumin in a pan over medium heat for 
        a minute or two, stir and avoid burning. Remove once aromatic. 
        Crush well in mortar and pestle (the finer the better). 
        (Alternately, you can just use ground spices, no need for toasting or a mortar & pestle.)</li>
        <li>Cut the rutabaga into cubes. Slice the leeks. In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium high, then add the rutabaga and cook for around 5 minutes, until it develops some color, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the leek and continue cooking, stirring another 5 minutes. Then add the stock and all the seasonings including 1/2 tsp salt and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for ~60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaves. Transfer the soup to a blender. Blend on high until extremely smooth. Blend in batches as needed. Alternately, blend in the saucepan with an immersion blender. Can freeze as desired. When serving, can garnish with minced fresh parsley, thyme, or other herbs.</li>
        
      </ol>
